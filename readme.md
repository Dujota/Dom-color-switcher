# DOM Color Scheme Switcher

Attached is the completed HTML and CSS for an incredibly advanced website. In anticipation of the millions of viewers it's going to draw, we'd like to let users customize their experience by choosing a color scheme for the site.

The only downside is none of us know Javascript!

Update the JS file such that when a user clicks on one of the colored dots the background color of the entire page changes to match that dot. You should not need to change any HTML or CSS.

When you're done, [it should display this functionality](https://git.generalassemb.ly/pages/ga-wdi-exercises/color-scheme-switcher/).


Bonus : 
- Create as many buttons as you would like, changing up as many different CSS properties as you'd want to use
- Instead of simply changing colors, create a color gradient, or set the background to be an image found on the web
- Do your changes through 'document.style...' and by toggling different classes
